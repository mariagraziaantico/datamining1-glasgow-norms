# datamining1-glasgow-norms
My first Data Mining Project (2021).

The project takes into consideration the dataset The Glasgow Norms, a collection of normative evaluations of 4500 English words, of which the psycholinguistic dimensionalities are highlighted. At the basis of this work there is a group of 1368 individuals of English birth, whose age varies from 16 to 73 years, who participated in the realization of the same, providing judgments on various words, focusing on evaluating this list of words according to 9 dimensions outline the characters, representing a substantial contribution to those academic studies, and not only, in the psycholinguistic sphere that until now had available nothing more than lexical collections particularly reduced and anything but multidimensional.

The aim of this paper is to find intresting patterns among the psycholinguistic characteristiscs of this collection of words, with regards on how words are learnt and felt.

Iit was carried out thanks to the collaboration of my colleagues: Davide Innocenti, Eleonora Baracco and Giorgia Cestaro.
